# Thank you for trying Scrabble Scrambler

To use, please install Python 3 if it is not currently available on your system.
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-python-3-latest-version/)

Thereafter, place the dictionary text files you'd like to use in the same folder as the script and run the script from the terminal as follows:
`python3 scrabble_scrambler.py`

The script will then step you through further instructions

Enjoy!
